##Futbol Refactor Deliverable

* Once methods completed, initial refactor involved helper methods being created and separated to shorten stat tracker methods. Helper methods were identified as methods that with application in multiple stat tracker method.

* Two modules created "mathable" and "helpable". All methods were then sorted to modules based on function. All helper methods that were used for calculation were placed in mathable module. All helper methods used to extract information to help methods were placed in helpable.

* Second refactor was executed in order to further shorten stat tracker methods, mathable, and helpable to less than 150 lines.
